I included some information about compiling the .dll in a comment on github, but that was just a general overview.  The invocation of cl for compiling this specific .dll in this specific file structure are slightly different.

Please take note this assumes you have run javah and written a .c file.  Also make sure you've run
vcvarsall.bat
with the option (no '-') x86 for 32-bit compilation and the option x86_amd64 for 64-bit compilation.

Once this has been done and you can invoke cl from the command line, cl needs to be run with the following command line options:
-I DLL      #to use the .h file generated by javah that should be in the DLL directory
-I "<jdk path>\include"      #has necessary headers for jni.
-I "<jdk path>\include\win32"      #has necessary headers for windows jni.
-LD      #Compile a dll
DLL\eepromprogrammer_SerialPortInterface.c      #path of C file to compile

On my computer, I had to invoke cl as follows
cl -I DLL -I "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_02\include" -I "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_02\include\win32" -LD DLL\eepromprogrammer_SerialPortInterface.c
